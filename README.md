## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a student at Technical University of Sofia, currently studying Computer and Software Engineering. I'm especially interested in databases â€“ designing, managing, and optimizing them.

ðŸ’» What I'm working on
ðŸ”¹ I work with various database management systems, including:


-> MySQL


-> Oracle


-> Microsoft SQL Server


-> PostgreSQL

I enjoy exploring different approaches to data modeling and solving real-world problems related to efficient data storage and access.
